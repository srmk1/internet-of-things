Why do we need proxy?
RFC defines two primary reasons for using proxies:
- When the request could not be otherwise made. Suppose application cannot talk coap, it can send http request to http to coap proxy. 
  Http-to-coap proxy would map http requests to coap requests and Coap-to-Http in reverse direction
- To service the response from a cache in order to reduce response time and network bandwidth or energy consumption.
  An intermediate node can cache responses and respond to many servers.

What are different types of proxies?
RFC Defines 2 types of proxies:
- Forward Proxy
- Reverese Proxy
